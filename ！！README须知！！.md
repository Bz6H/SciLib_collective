# SciLib_collective
This collective project is aimed to share notes with new second-year biomed students and help with your prestudy or revision, for free.
Notes are arranged by module codes, and sorted by authors initials
The notes are summarised by Biomed students from different streams, so they may contain errors or inaccuracies, if you are sure there is an error in the notes, please contact yuzhi.huang.22@ucl.ac.uk
Flashcards are saved in .apkg files and need to be downloaded and uploaded into your Anki app. 

PLS SHARE THE LINK (https://github.com/Bz6H/SciLib_collective) WITH MORE PEOPLE, THIS ALLOWS EVERYONE TO ACCESS AND PREVENT ANY BASTARDS FROM SELLING THESE FOR PROFIT.

If there are any issues with the content in the PDF or if you have other questions on the modules, please feel free to contact us.
